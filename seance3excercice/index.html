          >They have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed,
          slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). Twelve
          species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes.
          Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or
          sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the
          paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying
          group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island
          fox.[1] Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most
          common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes)
          with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of
          foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has
          contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in
          many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of
          hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the
          British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of
          the New World.</span
